# BusMall

This site is for gathering customer feedback on potential product offerings from BusMall, a shopping catalog distributed to buses nationwide.

The user is presented with several images of products, selecting which one they prefer from the three. Data on how many times they have viewed and selected each product is tracked and stored. Once they have voted a certain number of times, they are presented with a graph showing overall data for their views and clicks.

Using buttons at the top of the page, the user can take the survey again, or clear all of their existing data and start over completely.
